// The high case: FRACT_INC is too low by a fraction (n - 1) / n.
//               Add 1 to the fract counter always except every n times.
// A special case for 20 MHz: FRACT_INC is too low by the fraction 2. / 5.
//               Correct by adding 2 out of 5 times: every odd number in 0..4.
// A special case for 11.0592 MHz: FRACT_INC is too low by 5. / 27.
//               Correct brute force by counting 5 out of 27.
//               Do it the same way for the remaining odd cases.
// This way we correct losses from both the rounding to usecs and the shift.
