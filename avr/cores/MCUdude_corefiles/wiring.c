// with the integer rounded down version in FRACT_INC.
// For the clock speeds examined below, we encounter four different cases.
// The low case: FRACT_INC is too low by a fraction 1 / n.
//               Correct by adding 1 to the fract counter every n times.
// The high case: FRACT_INC is too low by a fraction (n - 1) / n.
//               Add 1 to the fract counter always except every n times.
// A special case for 20 MHz: FRACT_INC is too low by the fraction 2. / 5.
//               Correct by adding 2 out of 5 times: every odd number in 0..4.
// A special case for 11.0592 MHz: FRACT_INC is too low by 5. / 27.
//               Correct brute force by counting 5 out of 27.
