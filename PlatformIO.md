# PlatformIO

[PlatformIO](https://platformio.org) is an open source ecosystem for embedded development. 
It has a built-in library manager and is Arduino compatible. It supports most operating systems; Windows, MacOS, Linux 32 and 64-bit, ARM and X86.  
And best of all, MiniCore is supported!

## MiniCore + PlatformIO
MiniCore and PlatformIO goes great together. You can do serial uploads and upload using a dedicated programmer, but you can also let PlatformIO calulate the fuses and load the correct bootloader file, just like Arduino IDE does!

PlatformIO uses the information provided in platformio.ini to calculate what fuse bits and what bootloader file to load.  
Simply provide enough information and run the following commands:  

```ini
; Only set fuses
pio run -t fuses -e fuses_bootloader
; Set fuses and burn bootloader
pio run -t bootloader -e fuses_bootloader
; (where "fuses_bootloader" can be replace with a different environment to match your build configuration)
```

You can find a platformio.ini template you can use when creating a project for a MiniCore compatible device below.  
The most common functionality is available in this template. As you can see, the templated is divided into multiple environments.  

* The default build environment are defined under `[platformio]`.
* All parameters that are common for all environments are defined under `[env]`.
* Use `[env:Upload_UART]` or `[env:Upload_ISP]` to upload to your target.
* Use `[env:fuses_bootloader]` to set the fuses or burn the bootloader.

More information on what each line means can be found futher down on this page.

### `board_build.f_cpu`
Specifies the clock frequency in [Hz]. 
Used to determine what oscillator option to choose. A capital L has to be added to the end of the frequency number.
Below is a table with supported clocks for MiniCore. Defaults to 16 MHz if not specified.

| Clock speed | Oscillator | board_build.f_cpu         |

| 8 MHz       | Internal   | `8000000L`                |
| 1 MHz       | Internal   | `1000000L`                |


### `board_hardware.oscillator`
Spefices to use the internal or an external oscillator.  
Internal oscillator only works with `board_build.f_cpu` values `8000000L` and `1000000L`.

| Oscillator option    |
|----------------------|
| `external` (default) |
| `internal`           |


### `board_hardware.uart`
Specifies the hardware UART port used for serial upload. Use `no_bootloader` if youâ€™re using a dedicated programmer, i.e not using a bootloader for serial upload.

| Upload serial port option |
|---------------------------|
| `no_bootloader`           |
| `uart0` (default)         |
| `uart1` (328PB only)      |


### `board_hardware.bod`
Specifies the hardware brown-out detection. Use `disabled` to disable.

| ATmega48/88/168/328 | ATmega8          |
|---------------------|------------------|
| `4.3v`              | `4.0v`           |
| `2.7v` (default)    | `2.7v` (default) |
| `1.8v`              |                  |
| `disabled`          | `disabled`       |


### `board_hardware.eesave`
Specifies if the EEPROM memory should be retained when uploading using a programmer. Use `no` to disable.

| EEPROM retain   |
|-----------------|
| `yes` (default) |
| `no`            |


### `board_hardware.ckout`
Enable clock output on pin PB0 on targets that supports it (ATmega48/88/168/328).

| Clock output enable |
|---------------------|
| `yes`               |
| `no` (default)      |


### `board_hardware.cfd`
Enable clock failure detection. The internal 1 MHz oscillator will kick in if the external oscillator fails (only available on ATmega328PB).

| Clock failure detection |
|-------------------------|
| `yes`                   |
| `no` (default)          |


### `board_upload.speed` / `board_bootloader.speed`
Specifies the upload baud rate. Available baud rates is shown in the table below, had has to corrolate with `build_board.f_cpu`.  
  
**Note that if you're using a programmer that communicates with Avrdude with a serial port (Arduino as ISP, STK500, etc.) the `board_upload.speed` field will interfere with the programmer's baud rate.  
In this case, use `board_bootloader.speed` to set the bootloader baud rate, and `board_upload.speed` to set the baud rate for the programmer.**  
  
Recommended baud rate for the particular clock speed is in **bold text**.

|             | 1000000 | 500000 | 460800 | 250000 | 230400 | 115200 | 57600  | 38400  | 19200 | 9600   |

### `build_unflags`
This parameter is used to unflag. Since LTO is enabled by default in PlatformIO we may disable it by unflagging `-flto`.


### `build_flags`
This parameter is used to set compiler flags. This is useful if you want to for instance want to chage the serial RX or TX buffer. Here's a list of the current available core files flags:

### `build_flags`
This parameter is used to set compiler flags. This is useful if you want to for instance want to chage the serial RX or TX buffer. Here's a list of the current available core files flags:

| Flag                        | Default size | Description                                               |
|-----------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| -lprintf_flt                |              | Lets you print floats with printf (occupies ~1.5 kB)      |
| -Wall -Wextra               |              | Show all compiler warnings                                |
| -DSERIAL_RX_BUFFER_SIZE=128 | 64 bytes     | Sets the serial RX buffer to 128 bytes                    |
| -DSERIAL_TX_BUFFER_SIZE=128 | 64 bytes     | Sets the serial TX buffer to 128 bytes                    |
| -DTWI_BUFFER_SIZE=64        | 32 bytes     | Sets the TWI (i2c) buffer to 64 bytes                     |
| -DTWI1_BUFFER_SIZE=64       | 32 bytes     | Sets the TWI1 (i2c) buffer to 64 bytes (ATmega328PB only) |
| -DWIRE_TIMEOUT              |              | Enable timeout for the Wire and Wire1 library             |

**Example:**
`build_flags = -DSERIAL_RX_BUFFER_SIZE=128 -DSERIAL_TX_BUFFER_SIZE=128`


### `upload_port`
Specifies the serial port used for uploading. PlatformIO automatically detects the serial port. However, if you want to override this you can uncomment `upload_port`. Use `/dev/[port]` on Unix compatible systems, and use `COMx` on Windows.


### `upload_protocol`
Used when using a programmer rather than using a USB to serial adapter.  
Supports all Avrdude compatible programmers such as `usbasp`, `usbtiny` and `stk500v1`.


### `upload_flags`
Used to pass extra flags to Avrdude when uploading using a programmer.  
Typical parameters are `-PUSB`, `-B[clock divider]` and `-b[baudrate]`.  
**Note that every flag has to be on its own line, and they have to be indented with two spaces:**
```ini
upload_flags =
  -PUSB
  -B32
  -v
```


### `monitor_port`
PlatformIO detects serial ports automatically. However, In the template above it uses the upload port defined in the `env:Upload_UART` environment.
if you want to override this you can insert your upload port here. Use `/dev/[port]` on Unix compatible systems, and use `COMx` on Windows.


### `monitor_speed`
Sets the serial monitor baud rate. Defaults to 9600 if not defined.
